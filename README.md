The OMW PE Information web service response needs to convert XML to JSON as a requirement. After analyzing the technical aspect, I discovered a solution that involves using JSON_OBJECT to read XML and dynamically generate JSON, eliminating the need for writing queries to generate JSON. We have successfully completed the proof of concept (POC) and are now in the process of implementing the same logic in OMWS PE Info.

I assisted Vineetha in setting up the NPM package libraries on her computer. She encountered several challenges and struggled with them for a duration of two days. During that time, I provided guidance, support, and troubleshooting assistance to help her overcome the difficulties and successfully configure the required NPM package libraries on her machine.

As part of the CPQ integration process, we have a requirement to connect with the CPQ web service in order to transmit the Order status information after the Order has been processed. To fulfill this requirement, I am currently conducting a thorough analysis of the necessary steps and considerations involved. Additionally, I am actively working on developing a proof of concept (POC) to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of accessing the CPQ web service from DEVO2 using PLSQL.

The purpose of this endeavor is to establish a reliable and efficient means of communication between the two systems. By leveraging PLSQL, we aim to streamline the integration process and ensure smooth transmission of Order status updates from DEVO2 to the CPQ web service. This initiative will ultimately enhance the overall integration capabilities and enable seamless coordination between the systems involved.
