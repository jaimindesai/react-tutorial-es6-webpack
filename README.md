We are currently encountering difficulties accessing the external web service CPQ from DEVO2 using PLSQL. Collaboratively, I collaborated with the DBA to successfully install the certificate provided by the CPQ team. However, despite our efforts, we continue to face an issue with an invalid certificate. Our team has been actively coordinating with the network, CPQ, and DBA teams to effectively address and resolve this matter.

Jim Malone recently made a request for statistical data regarding the number of orders that have originated from the Retirement Service (RS) during the current fiscal year. In response to his inquiry, I have taken the initiative to formulate queries and gather the necessary information to provide comprehensive statistics specifically pertaining to orders from RS within the ongoing fiscal year.

We have completed the new PE Info web service, which converts XML to JSON. We are currently doing unit testing and code reviews. In OMWS, we have a Processing Sales Order web service that consumes XML files, but most of the integration partners want to use JSON instead of XML. We are doing POC for converting JSON to XML, so there is no need to change business logic for loading data in different tables.
