We are facing an issue with accessing the external web service CPQ from DEVO2 using PLSQL. I worked with DBA to install the certificate, which was provided by the CPQ team. But we are still facing an invalid certificate issue. We have been coordinating with the network, CPQ, and DBA teams to resolve this issue.

Jim Malone requested some statistics about how many orders have come from Retirement Service so far this fiscal year. I have prepared queries and provided statistics for orders from RS during this fiscal year.

We have completed the new PE Info web service, which converts XML to JSON. We are currently doing unit testing and code reviews. In OMWS, we have a Processing Sales Order web service that consumes XML files, but most of the integration partners want to use JSON instead of XML. We are doing POC for converting JSON to XML, so there is no need to change business logic for loading data in different tables.
